# Solar System Project

## Project Brief

My final project at CodeClan Edinburgh. We were tasked with creating our own product based on areas we wanted to learn about or review from the course.

## Description

This is a rails back-end and react front-end full stack project. Focus was on efficiency using React JS and CSS.
Most interesting part is probably the use of React to creat objects using my custom API, each of which is then animated using CSS animations.
The solar system is interactive. You can use the drop down menus given or select the objects themselves to give pop-up information on them.
